https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vveg0x594o,Biden student debt relief halted by court challenges,"Two federal courts have temporarily blocked key portions of US President Joe Biden's student loan debt relief and repayment plan.
The dual rulings blocks potential debt relief that millions of borrowers may have seen in less than a week.
The White House said it would ""continue to vigorously defend"" its forgiveness and repayment proposals.
More than one in 10 Americans hold federal student debt - and it is a major election issue for young voters. 
To date, Mr Biden has approved nearly $150bn (£118bn) in relief affecting close to five million people - but largely through executive actions, and not via Congress.
The president's broader ambitions for mass relief have, however, been stymied, with the Supreme Court last year striking down a major proposal to cancel as much as $400bn in loans.
Monday's rulings deal a blow to Saving on a Valuable Education (Save), which the president has touted as ""the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever"".
The Save programme extends payment periods, and effectively forgives the debts of almost all who borrowed $12,000 or less.
Two coalitions of Republican politicians filed lawsuits against Save, accusing the president of ""unilaterally trying to impose an extraordinarily expensive and controversial policy that he could not get through Congress"".
Two judges ruled on those cases on Monday, temporarily halting the programme.
In Kansas, US District Judge Daniel Crabtree blocked parts of Save intended to reduce  monthly payments and payment periods for borrowers with loans larger than $12,000.
In Missouri, US District Judge John Ross prevented the education department from forgiving loan balances.
Both judges, who were appointed by Barack Obama, echoed arguments from the Supreme Court that Mr Biden's efforts overstepped his legal authority.
However, Save was not struck down in its entirety.
Monday's preliminary orders halt the plan in its current status quo until a trial of the separate lawsuits can decide their merits. Both judges however concluded that the Republicans' arguments would likely prevail at trial.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who led the coalition lawsuits that represent 18 Republican-led states, hailed the dual rulings.
Mr Kobach called the decisions a ""victory for the entire country"" against an administration ""attempting to usurp Congress's authority"".
""Only Congress has the power of the purse, not the president,"" Mr Bailey wrote. ""Today's ruling was a huge win for the rule of law, and for every American who Joe Biden was about to force to pay off someone else's debt.""
The administration meanwhile promised to continue pushing forward with its plan.
""It's unfortunate that Republican elected officials and their allies have fought tooth and nail to prevent their constituents from accessing lower payments and a faster path to debt forgiveness,"" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.
""Today’s rulings won’t stop our administration from using every tool available to give students and borrowers the relief they need.""
More than 400,000 Save participants have already seen some or all of their debts cancelled, including many low-income borrowers.
A second phase of the programme was due to further reduce payments from 1 July. That included halving monthly bills for low-income participants."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn00e8dzq46o,"At first Biden-Trump debate, age will be in the spotlight","For Joe Biden and Donald Trump - the two oldest candidates ever to seek the US presidency - age is an election issue neither can escape.
On Thursday, the current Democratic president, 81, and his Republican predecessor, 78, will face off in Atlanta, Georgia, for the first of two debates ahead of November’s vote, offering Americans a rare, split-screen comparison of the two men’s physical and mental strength.
For 90 minutes, under the glare of the high-definition cameras, President Biden and former President Trump — who remain nearly tied in national opinion polls — will spar on issues ranging from the economy and foreign wars to immigration and the future of democracy. One slip-up, stumble or verbal miscue could cement concerns about their advanced age, with the potential for reshaping an already tight presidential race as voters begin to pay attention.
But delivering a vigorous performance may be more critical for Mr Biden, the nation’s oldest president who has been dogged by questions about his stamina and mental fitness since he took office.
“There’s no hiding the fact that Biden’s 81, there’s no hiding the fact that Trump’s basically the same age,"" said Jim Messina, a Democratic strategist who managed Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign. ""It’s not a contest of age, it’s a contest of policy and character.”
“Part of what needs to happen on Thursday night is just to begin the conversation about the differences between them,"" Mr Messina said.
Polling shows that voters are far more concerned about Mr Biden’s age than his opponent’s. But if Trump wins, he would break Mr Biden’s record as the oldest president before the end of his term.
A March New York Times/Siena College poll suggested 73% of registered voters believed Mr Biden was “just too old to be an effective president”. Voters of all age groups expressed these concerns about the president’s fitness for office, including those 65 and older, according to the survey.
Just 42% of registered voters said the same about Trump, despite a mere three-and-a-half-year age gap.
“It ought to be about both of them, but Biden looks his age,” said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
Mr Biden was declared “fit for duty” earlier this year by a White House physician, but concerns about his age have persisted since he took office. Signs of his aging have become more notable in recent years, including a softer speaking voice, occasional memory lapses and a “stiffened gait” which his doctor partly attributes to arthritis.
As president, he is “covered almost every moment he is out in public” which means he endures more scrutiny than his challenger, Mr Sabato said.
Videos of routine actions - walking up and down Air Force One’s stairway, crossing a stage at public events — are watched closely online and in conservative media.
When Mr Biden tripped and fell at an Air Force Academy graduation in June 2023, the tumble made national news. After being helped to his feet, he continued to stand and walk as normal. His team said he had tripped on a sandbag on the stage, and the president later told reporters at the White House, “I got sandbagged!”
Some Democrats have publicly and privately expressed reservations about the president’s age, but they rallied around him in February, when justice department special counsel Robert Hur released his investigation into Mr Biden’s handling of classified documents after his term as vice-president.
The report did not recommend prosecuting him, but Mr Hur’s description of the president as an an ""elderly man with a poor memory” made headlines.
But when Mr Biden gave his annual State of the Union address a few weeks later, pundits gave him high marks for an energetically delivered speech.
“The president always delivers in big moments,” Congressman Ro Khanna, a Biden campaign surrogate, told NBC News last week. “He did in the State of the Union. And people are going to see the difference.”
The Biden campaign is hoping Thursday’s debate will be another moment in which the president demonstrates he can endure the rigours of governing, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump on policy and temperament.
Ahead of the debate, Donald Trump suggested his opponent could exceed expectations, telling the All-In podcast in a 20 June appearance that he assumed Mr Biden was ""going to be somebody [who] will be a worthy debater”.
""I don’t want to underestimate him,” he added. Trump has separately spread unsubstantiated claims that the president will take performance-enhancing drugs to put in a good performance, which the Biden campaign has described as “desperate lies”.
While the scrutiny around Trump’s age is not as intense, the former president has faced questions about his own fitness for office.
At a January rally, Trump appeared to confuse his Republican primary rival, Nikki Haley, with former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for several minutes during his speech.
He claimed, incorrectly, that Ms Haley had been “in charge of security” at the time of the 6 January attack on Congress. Ms Haley, Trump’s former UN ambassador, called for “mental competency tests” for politicians over 75 during her own unsuccessful presidential run.
Trump’s personal physician issued a statement in November attesting that his “cognitive exams were exceptional”.
At a Saturday rally in Pennsylvania, Trump complained of a double standard between the media’s treatment of himself and Mr Biden.
“If I say one word slightly out, they say, ‘He’s cognitively impaired,’” Trump told supporters. ""Whereas Biden can run into walls. He can fall off the stage. He can fall up the stairs. He falls up.”
Both campaigns have sought to shape the narrative around their opposing candidate through social media, amplifying video snippets of verbal gaffes, memes and in some cases, deceptively edited footage.
More recently, Republicans and rightwing media have intensified attacks on Mr Biden’s mental competence, circulating a flurry of edited video clips including one of the president appearing to wander off during the G7 summit of world leaders in Italy. The unedited footage showed Mr Biden was walking to greet paratroopers during a skydiving demonstration.
Days later, conservative critics shared footage online of the president at a Los Angeles fundraiser, standing on stage before Barack Obama reaches for his arm and they walk off stage together. Donald Trump and other Republicans claimed it was evidence that Mr Biden had frozen up and had to be led off stage. But allies of the president pointed to longer clips that appeared to show Mr Biden smiling and taking in the crowd’s applause.
The Biden campaign has responded with a rapid response effort on social media, sharing content that appears to similarly raise questions about Trump’s mental acuity. They’ve posted clips of Trump appearing to walk off stage before he is supposed to and being redirected by others including former Vice-President Mike Pence and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Yet even as some of these videos are easily disproved, voters' reservations around Biden’s age continue to be one of his biggest vulnerabilities.
This is particularly true for younger voters, who are traditionally a more important demographic to Democrats than Republicans in national elections, organisers say.
Watching the debate could be an “eye-opening experience” for younger voters, said Amanda Litman, a Democratic strategist and founder of Run For Something, an organisation that trains and supports the next generation of Democratic candidates.
“I think it is indicative of a structure of politics that has privileged an older generation to stay in power for a long time,” Ms Litman said of the candidates' ages. “It is one of many reasons why, especially younger voters, feel disengaged. They don’t see themselves reflected in leadership.”
Brandt Williams, a 23-year-old accountant from Connecticut, said he will support Mr Biden again in 2024. He sees Mr Biden as a statesman who has a strong handle on foreign policy, and he supports the president's economic policies.
“The one issue is pretty common,” Mr Williams said. “His age.”
Though he planned to tune into Thursday’s debate, Mr Williams said he wished that he could vote for a “younger person, not only for vitality, but to represent all Americans, both young and old”.
In the critical battleground of Georgia, where the first debate will take place, Democrats told the BBC they sense apathy among their party’s young voters, with age a sticking point for many.
“Biden is stuck in a position where the younger generation wants action… they don’t want a speech about how we’re better as a nation,” said Titus Nichols, a 39-year-old attorney who is active in the Cobb County Democratic Party.
While the president “is the more mature, steady person, that’s not what people are looking for”, he added.
On Thursday evening, millions of people will be tuning in not only to hear the candidates’ ideas and arguments, but to judge the nominees’ stamina for themselves.
For Mr Biden, delivering a punch is critical if he wants to quell fears about his age, according to Ms Litman, the Democratic strategist.
“I think he needs to show competency and confidence,” she said. “And a little bit of fight.”"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gx7d0qwdo,Biden assures campaign donors he can still win election,"US President Joe Biden has assured Democrat donors that he can still win November's presidential election against Donald Trump, after a poor debate performance fuelled concern about his candidacy.
The president, 81, attended a series of fundraising events in New York and New Jersey on Saturday, and defended his performance in CNN's Presidential Debate.
Speaking at one event, Mr Biden admitted, ""I didn’t have a great night, but neither did Trump” on Thursday.
""I promise you we're going to win this election,"" he said.
Mr Biden's debate performance was marked by hard-to-follow and shaky answers - raising fresh fears among some Democrats over whether he is the right candidate to contest this high-stakes election.
Former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Biden's debate performance “wasn’t great” - while his former communications director, Kate Bedingfield, called it “really disappointing”.
Voters in the US have regularly shared doubts about Mr Biden's mental and cognitive health, and early polling after the debate shows the number who doubt his ability to serve as president has only grown.
On 9 June, a CBS News poll found that 65% of registered voters said that the president does not have the mental fitness to serve as president. The network released a new poll on Sunday that showed that number had jumped to 72% after his poor debate performance.
Biden campaign chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said on Saturday, however, that internal post-debate polling showed ""voters' opinions were not changed"". 
""It will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,"" she said.
While the Biden campaign has acknowledged that the debate had not gone as they had hoped, it has maintained its stance that the president will not step aside for another nominee.
Mr Biden has also said he understands the concerns, but pledged to fight harder.
New Jersey's Democratic governor Phil Murphy attended the fundraiser in his state alongside Mr Biden and the First Lady - and told Mr Biden that ""we are all with you 1,000%"".
Former President Barack Obama, who remains a popular figure in the Democratic party, said on social media that ""bad debate nights happen"".
""This election is still a choice between someone who fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Mr Obama wrote.
Hours after the debate, Mr Trump told his supporters that he considered the debate a ""big victory"" for his campaign.
""Joe Biden's problem is not his age,"" the 78-year-old Trump said. ""It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent.""
Mr Biden's performance was not only criticised by those in politics.
A prominent editorial in the New York Times described his determination to run again as a ""reckless gamble"", and urged him to do some soul-searching this weekend.
It said Democrats should ""acknowledge that Mr Biden can’t continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place"".
Voters across the United States have also expressed concerns over voting for either candidate following Thursday's debate.
Long-time Democrat Lori Gregory told the BBC that she ""could not handle"" watching the debate, and asked, ""is this the best our country can do?""
Republican Crystal Myers-Barber said it was ""painful to watch"", but added that she thought ""Trump came across very level-headed and presidential and Biden came across very weak.""
Democrat Shana Ziolko said she was ""frustrated"" watching the debate, and thought there was no clear winner.
A post-debate poll by liberal pollster Data for Progress found that 62% of likely voters who watched or read about the debate found Trump won. Only 30% of those polled said Mr Biden won the debate.
Until further polling is conducted, fundraising could be another indication of continued enthusiasm for Mr Biden's candidacy.
In a memo, chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said the campaign had raised more than $27m (£21.3m) from the Thursday debate to Friday evening.
""Following Thursday night’s debate, the beltway class is counting Joe Biden out. The data in the battleground states, though, tells a different story,"" she said.
""This election was incredibly close before Thursday, and by every metric we’ve seen since, it remains just as close"", she added."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66xljl5p2o, Secret Service agent robbed at gunpoint near Biden LA fundraiser,"A US Secret Service agent was robbed at gunpoint in Southern California over the weekend near where President Joe Biden was attending a campaign fundraiser, California police say. 
The agent was returning from a work assignment when the robbery occurred,  US Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told BBC News.
The agent's bag was stolen, the Tustin Police Department said in a statement. 
The number of suspects, their identity and their whereabouts remain unclear. 
The robbery took place Saturday night just after 9:30 pm local time in Tustin, a town 40 miles (64km) south east of Los Angeles. 
The Secret Service agent fired his weapon during the robbery, Mr Guglielmi said, but it's unclear if the assailants were struck. 
Tustin Police said the suspect or suspects had fled the scene by the time they arrived. 
The incident remains under investigation, though police said ""there is no known threat to the public"". 
Mr Biden was in Los Angeles over the weekend to attend campaign fundraiser alongside former President Barack Obama, George Clooney, Barbra Streisand, Julia Roberts and late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel. "

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrrz4e33eno,Wolverhampton: the election battleground,"Wolverhampton's iconic home of football, Molineux, is proudly adorned in gold and black. 
The city of Wolverhampton, in contrast, has been represented in political colours by red and blue since the last general election. 
Labour entered the 2019 campaign in possession of all three constituencies in the city.
Under Boris Johnson's leadership the Conservatives secured a 2-1 polling day win, taking two of the three of the seats.
Wolverhampton South West and Wolverhampton North East elected new Conservative MPs in Stuart Anderson and Jane Stevenson, while Wolverhampton South East stayed loyal to long-serving Labour MP, Pat McFadden
In this election campaign, Wolverhampton is once again a key battleground.
Boundary changes mean all the seats have altered in shape, with boundaries moved to adjust the number of constituents living in each. Wolverhampton South West has a new name too, of Wolverhampton West. 
Could industrial heritage help indicate the decisions voters may make in the polling booths on July 4th?
David Holt, history and politics lecturer at City of Wolverhampton College says it could be a clean sweep for Labour. 
""Historically, Wolverhampton is an industrial city. It has been a Labour stronghold in the past. Now we are in a post-industrial landscape it will be a very positive sign for Labour if voters turn back that way and Labour take a stronghold back.""
""The opinion polls suggest Labour may retake those seats they lost 5 years ago, or at least one of those. If the party wins all seats in Wolverhampton it could be seen as a national indicator of a very healthy Labour majority.""
Carvers Building Supplies is a fifth-generation family-run business which employs 250 people.
The firm's managing director, Henry Carver, is closely watching the election campaign for the manifesto pledges which may impact his business.
""You have to hope they're going to give you stability and not a huge amount of changes or shocks. I'm concerned by both sides, will Labour have enough money with their promises? Will the Conservatives have enough money with their promises of tax cuts?""

Mr Carver estimated that the rise in interest rates had led to a decline in the home building sector of approximately 20%.
""When you make an investment you make an investment for a five-to-ten year return and to employ people. What you don't want is the government changing the rules. What we want now is stability so we can make investment decisions.""
The general election has been the subject of conversation among his employees too.
Steve Ayland felt it was hard for voters to make a clear decision.
""I think it's immensely difficult, unless there's an issue to really worry you. It's a very negative campaign, it feels that everybody is against something, instead of for something, so it's really difficult to know where to place your vote.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511pyn3xw3o,Six swing states set to decide the US election,"About 240 million people are eligible to vote in this year’s US election, but only a relatively small number of them are likely to settle the question of who becomes the next president.
Experts believe there are only a handful of states that could plausibly be won by either Democratic President Joe Biden or his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
Six of them - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – appear to be on a knife edge and probably hold the key to who will take the White House.
So both parties are campaigning intensively to win over undecided voters in these states.
Mr Biden gained the presidency in 2020 with the support of the Grand Canyon State, which narrowly voted to back a Democratic candidate for the first time since the 1990s.
This state borders Mexico for hundreds of miles, and has become a focal point of the nation’s immigration debate. Arrivals at the US border have hit record highs while Mr Biden has been in office, presenting him with a major electoral headache. Border crossings have fallen in recent months but he has toughened his stance and made plans to enact border shutdowns when crossings surge.
Mr Trump has repeatedly attacked his rival’s record on immigration, and has vowed to carry out “the largest deportation operation” in US history if he regains the presidency.
Arizona has also hosted a bitter row over abortion access, after state Republicans attempted to reinstate a 160-year-old near-total ban on terminating pregnancies. It’s become an explosive issue nationwide since 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned a landmark ruling that gave women the constitutional right to abortion.
Our list of swing states closely matches the list of places in which Trump-backed Republican officials tried to thwart Mr Biden’s win in the 2020 election. In Georgia, alleged election interference has landed Mr Trump in one of his four criminal cases.
He and 18 others are accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat to Mr Biden in the state. He denies any wrongdoing, and the case looks increasingly unlikely to be heard in court before the election.
At any rate, it remains to be seen whether Mr Trump’s legal headaches will harm him at the ballot box. We may find out soon, now that his hush-money trial has ended with a guilty verdict.
At 33%, Georgia has one of the country’s highest proportions of African-Americans in its population, and it is believed that this demographic was instrumental in Mr Biden flipping the state in 2020. However, disillusionment has been reported among America’s black voters, with some saying not enough has been done to combat racial injustice or deliver on the economy.
The Great Lakes state has picked the winning presidential candidate in the last two elections. Despite backing Mr Biden in 2020, it has become symbolic of a nationwide backlash over the president’s support for Israel during that country’s war in Gaza.
During Michigan’s Democratic primary contest in February, more than 100,000 voters chose the “uncommitted” option on their ballots, after a campaign was mounted by activists who want the US government to back a ceasefire in Gaza and to halt its military aid to Israel.
Notably, Michigan has the country’s largest proportion of Arab-Americans - a demographic whose support for Mr Biden looks to be in jeopardy.
Mr Trump has highlighted the state’s significance in his potential path to victory. Commenting on events in the Middle East, he has called on Israel to finish its campaign over Hamas in Gaza, but ""get it over with fast”.
The Silver State has voted Democrat for the last several elections, but there are signs of a possible turnaround by the Republicans. Recent averages published by poll-tracking firm 538 indicate that Mr Trump has been enjoying a healthy lead over Mr Biden there. Both men are vying to win the state’s sizeable Latino population.
Despite the fact that the US economy has shown strong growth and jobs creation since Mr Biden took the presidency, the post-Covid recovery has been slower in Nevada than elsewhere.
At 5.1%, the state has the highest unemployment rate in the country, after California and the District of Columbia, according to the latest US government statistics.
If Mr Trump wins power again, he has vowed a return to an agenda of lower taxes across the board, and fewer regulations.
Pennsylvanians are far from unique among Americans for feeling cost-of-living pressures as a result of inflation. But the price of groceries has risen faster in their state than in any other, according to market intelligence provider Datasembly.
The BBC recently reported on how people were struggling to cope in Erie - a bellwether county for the rest of Pennsylvania, where as many as one in eight people are considered “food insecure”.
The state proved pivotal in the 2020 election, backing Mr Biden in his successful White House bid. He has a deep emotional connection to the working-class city of Scranton, where he grew up.
High inflation could hurt Mr Biden across the US as polling suggests it is giving voters an unfavorable view of the economy.
Mr Trump has sought to attack his adversary over persistently high prices. But he has his own challenges in Pennsylvania after a relatively strong showing there by his Republican primary rival Nikki Haley.
The Badger State also picked the winning presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020, by a margin of little more than 20,000 votes each time.
Pundits have suggested it is in marginal states like these where an impact could be made by third-party candidates who are campaigning against the policies of the big two candidates.
Polling has indicated that a sizeable show of support for an independent such as Robert F Kennedy Jr - who is fighting to get on the ballot in Wisconsin and other states - could harm the vote tallies for Mr Biden or Mr Trump.
Mr Trump has described that state as “really important… if we win Wisconsin, we win the whole thing”. The summer Republican National Convention will be held in the city of Milwaukee.
Mr Biden recently pointed to a new Microsoft data centre heading to Wisconsin as evidence of how he was delivering new jobs; arguing that his predecessor had been unable to deliver on his pledges."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv22e75g4n4o,Mexico election: US closely watches as neighbour votes,"Mexico's upcoming presidential election has already attracted a lot of media attention due to the fact that it is expected to deliver the country’s first female head of state.
Opinion polls have given the frontrunner, Claudia Sheinbaum, and her main rival, Xóchitl Gálvez, such a large lead over their male rivals, that a female president looks like a foregone conclusion.
But whoever wins this coming Sunday will have to deal with the sensitive relationship with the United States, which is not only Mexico’s northern neighbour but also its top commercial partner.
How to handle the Mexican drug cartels – largely blamed by US authorities for the deadly epidemic of fentanyl overdoses and deaths in the US – is not the only daunting issue for the Mexican presidential candidates. 
The winner will also have to deal with the record flows through Mexico of US-bound foreign migrants that are a burning topic in the US’ own 2024 electoral race.

The scenario is complicated by the possibility of the return to the US presidency of Donald Trump, whose strident positions on migrants and drugs have raised eyebrows south of the border.
Mr Trump has vowed to carry out the ""largest deportation operation"" in US history to remove undocumented migrants already in the country if he returns to the White House.
Some Mexican media commentators are calling a possible second Trump presidency ""the elephant in the room"" for Mexico's presidential hopefuls.
Both Ms Sheinbaum and Ms Gálvez have emphasised the importance of Mexico's relationship with the US, and they have both pledged to broadly pursue good bilateral cooperation.
Ms Sheinbaum, who is running for the governing Morena party, has vowed to continue with ""pride"" the foreign policy of her mentor, outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
Relations between the US and Mexico during the six years Mr López Obrador has been in power have not been without tension, with disagreements flaring over US counter-narcotics operations inside Mexico, as well as over measures taken by the US on its border to try to control migrants.
Opposition contender Xóchitl Gálvez has called the outgoing government's foreign policy a ""disaster"". 
But like Ms Sheinbaum, she has also taken a strongly pro-migrant stance, particularly with respect to Mexican migrants in the US.
Aware that nationalist pride plays strongly in Mexico, both candidates made a point in a recent presidential debate of stressing that their governments would not let themselves be cowed or bullied by the US, especially over migration.
Ms Sheinbaum declared that there would be ""no more submission in foreign policy"", saying that centre-right predecessors of Mr López Obrador had allowed themselves to be ""humiliated"" by the US.
""Coordination yes, subordination no,"" she said, summarising her vision of relations with the US back in March. 
“We will always tell them [the US] it’s better to build bridges rather than walls,"" she added a few weeks later.
Opposition contender Xóchitl Gálvez has also pledged a “frank, direct and clear” relationship with the US, which she has recognised as ""our most important market"".
In one of the presidential debates she reproached the current government for having ""caved in"" to then President Donald Trump by agreeing to keep US-bound migrants in Mexico after the right-wing US leader threatened to slap tariff penalties on Mexican goods.
She has also said that, as president, she would not ""bow down without putting up a fight"".
However, she added that ""authoritarian governments like Venezuela, Russia, Cuba, [and] Nicaragua won't be coming to parade here"", indicating that her government would be less friendly to such overtly anti-US leaders than the current Mexican government and its candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum.
The two rivals have also sparred over immigration and security policies, key areas in which Mexico has periodically faced US complaints of not providing enough cooperation.
Ms Sheinbaum has repeated President López Obrador's calls for the US to invest more in Mexico and Central America to help reduce the pressure for northwards migration. The ""United States can do more,"" she has argued.
Ms Gálvez too has listed ""protection of migrants"" among her priorities, including a call for the ""regularisation [of the status] of our compatriots who live in the United States"".
In their public statements at least, both of the leading Mexican presidential contenders have promised cooperation with the US against drug-trafficking.
While critics in Mexico and the US have accused President López Obrador of putting curbs on counter-narcotics cooperation, especially on the activities in Mexico of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Ms Gálvez has said she would not limit exchange of information with the US.
Across the border in the US, Republican Party candidate Donald Trump has made it clear that he would double down on plans to secure the US border with barriers and troops, even reportedly suggesting he might send ""kill teams"" into Mexico to eliminate cartel leaders.
When asked about a possible Trump victory, both Ms Sheinbaum and Ms Gálvez said they could handle and maintain good ties.
“President López Obrador in the end had a good relationship with Trump and I don’t see why we wouldn’t be able to have it as well,” Ms Sheinbaum said recently.
Ms Gálvez has also said she was “not afraid of Trump nor of Biden”, and would work with either."

There are countless ways US foreign policy - and the actions of the White House - has an impact on different parts of the globe.
American influence abroad is sure to play a part in the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump on Thursday.
But it's not just in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza that this election matters. 
Eight of the BBC's foreign correspondents explain why this election rematch is making waves where they are.
By Steve Rosenberg, Russia editor, Moscow
Imagine you’re Vladimir Putin. Who would you prefer in the White House?
The man who’s called you “a killer” and pledged to stand by Ukraine? (that’s Joe Biden).
Or the candidate who has criticised US military assistance to Kyiv and said he’d encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any Nato member country that doesn’t meet defence spending guidelines (a certain Donald Trump).
Always keen to surprise, the Kremlin leader has gone on record as saying he’d actually prefer Joe Biden to keep his job because of his “predictability”.
Such a public endorsement, though, should be taken with an extremely large pinch of Russian salt. Moscow is likely to view the election of a Nato-sceptic, Ukraine-sceptic US president as three lemons for Russia on the geo-political fruit machine.
Not that there’s a guaranteed pay-out for Moscow. The Kremlin was left disappointed by the first Trump presidency.
In 2016 one Russian official admitted to me having celebrated Mr Trump’s victory with a cigar and a bottle of champagne. But the champagne went flat. The Russian authorities had expected an improvement in Russia-US relations - that never materialised.
Who’s to say a second Trump presidency wouldn’t leave Moscow feeling similarly underwhelmed.
Whoever wins the race for the White House, the Russian authorities will be watching closely for signs of post-election political instability and polarisation in America and looking for ways to benefit.

Both candidates are vying to be tough on Beijing and have similar economic policies to combat China’s rise including raising tariffs on cheap Chinese goods.
But they have very different approaches to dealing with China’s regional influence.
Biden has shored up relationships there, in the hope that a united front sends a clear message to an increasingly assertive Beijing.
But when president, Trump focused less on being a statesman and more on what he saw was the “best deal”. He threatened to remove US troops from South Korea unless Seoul paid Washington more money.
The biggest difference between the two is on Taiwan.
On multiple occasions, Biden has reiterated a pledge to come to the self-governing island’s defence if President Xi makes good on his promise to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, by force if necessary.
But Trump has accused Taiwan of undermining American businesses and he has expressed opposition to a US bill which sent aid there. That led some to question whether he would be willing to come to Taipei’s aid if needed.
When the US votes, China is unlikely to have a favourite in the fight.
In Beijing’s view, an unpredictable Trump could weaken and divide US allies in the region - but he could also create another trade war.
They won’t be too keen on another four years of Biden either. They believe his alliance building has the potential to create a new Cold War.
By Gordon Corera, security correspondent, Kyiv
There is perhaps no foreign country for whom the US election matters more than Ukraine.
Everyone knows US support in the form of money and weapons has been vital in sustaining Ukraine’s war effort. Few believe that Europe could quickly or easily step into any gap.
But here in Kyiv, most people are less focused on the ins and outs of the campaign than you would expect.
That is because, as one person told me, November feels a long way away. There are more pressing concerns as cities come under attack from Russian glide bombs and as Ukrainian forces battle to prevent Russian advances.
They are very aware of what is being said about Ukraine during the campaign. When it comes to Donald Trump, analysts here know he has talked about bringing an end to a war and that there is talk of cutting aid.
While some fear he could force Ukraine into a deal it does not like, experts caution that what will matter is what someone does in office, not what they say during the campaign or in a debate.
And there is an understanding that even a Joe Biden win will not prevent challenges, given how long it took to get the last aid package passed by Congress.
So the stakes for Ukraine are high but it remains only a spectator, and unpredictability is something Ukrainians have long learnt to live with.

Policymakers in the UK tell me they are looking at the US election with some trepidation.
On one level, there is a nervousness about potential decisions that could affect the UK.
Would a President Trump returning to the White House weaken US military support for Ukraine and cosy up to Vladimir Putin?
Would he pick another fight with Europe over the Nato military alliance? Would he spark a trade war with China?
Would a second-term President Biden increase US isolationism and protectionism? Would he be up for the role physically for another four years?
On another level, there is a broader concern. There is a fear in the UK that a close result on November 5, one that is not accepted as legitimate by many American voters, could lead to political violence worse than the storming of the Capitol in January 2021.
A crisis of American democracy may damage US global leadership and encourage autocrats the world over.
All this worries UK politicians in both major parties as they prepare for their own election on 4 July.
Would they at some point have to choose between supporting democratic values and staying close to a traditional ally? Would they have to choose between the US and Europe on some big issue?
Above all, the US election presents the UK with more uncertainty in an increasingly uncertain world.

Both candidates are being closely watched in the knowledge that the White House race will have real consequences.
President Biden strongly backed Israel after the shocking 7 October attacks and has continued to supply the country with weapons even as he has become more critical of the fighting and the high number of Palestinian civilians being killed.
Overall, polls suggest a higher share of Jewish Israelis think Trump would be better for Israel than Biden. Most disapprove of Biden’s handling of the war. And Palestinians widely see him as neglecting their suffering.
Israelis positively recall how Trump formally recognised Jerusalem as their capital and struck new deals to set up diplomatic ties between their country and Arab states.
He supports the war in Gaza but has also urged Israel to “get it over with,” arguing its image is being damaged.
While Palestinians see little hope in a second Biden term, Trump could see them even worse off. The former president has promised, if elected, to cut off all US aid to Palestinians.
In the longer-term, President Biden continues to support a two-state solution - the established international formula for peace - although he has not given a concrete plan for achieving one.  Trump has questioned the viability of an independent Palestinian state.
Conventional wisdom has it that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would like to see Trump back in power.  However, the former president is said to resent him for acknowledging Biden’s victory in 2020.

In the eyes of the White House, India is in a sweet spot.
The United States sees India as a geopolitical counterweight to China. India also has the fifth largest economy in the world, set to become the third largest by 2030. Earlier this month, the country held the world’s largest democratic elections which saw Narendra Modi become prime minister for a third consecutive term.
Although India has been accused of democratic backsliding and misrepresenting the true economic picture domestically, none of that really factors for the United States given India’s strategic importance.
Whatever happens in November doesn’t make a difference to how India will operate on the global stage. Both candidates are known entities.
If Biden remains president then the status quo prevails, which means a healthy trading relationship and the red carpet treatment. Just last year Modi was in Washington for an official state visit complete with a lavish reception at the White House in honour of the prime minister who also addressed a joint session of Congress.
If Trump is re-elected, the only difference might be a question of tone. He has previously called Modi an exceptional leader. Trump visited India in 2020 where tens of thousands of people came to see the American president, side by side with their prime minister in Modi’s home state of Gujarat.
Proof that India can deal with whichever political outcome.

Mexicans have recently held their presidential election making a historic choice: electing Claudia Sheinbaum as the country’s first female president.
Her close ally, outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, forged an unlikely partnership with Donald Trump when he was in the White House. While Mexico’s relations with Mr Biden have at times been tense, the neighbours have consistently found common ground in critical areas like immigration and cross-border trade.
Once in power, Sheinbaum will need to show she is not just an extension of the previous administration – and what better way to do that than through relations with Washington? As such, she may try to be different in tone and approach to her predecessor, if not in substance, when it comes to working with either Biden or a potential second Trump presidency.
Speaking to the BBC on the campaign trail, Claudia Sheinbaum said she was unfazed by the prospect of either man in the White House. “I will fight for Mexicans,” she told me.
Mexicans themselves, however, remember Trump’s presidency with no fondness. The provocative rhetoric alone – “drug dealers, criminals, rapists”, as he called Mexican immigrants when he descended the infamous gold escalator to launch his campaign in 2016 – still sticks in the craw for many here.

America's northern neighbour has some worries about a second Donald Trump presidency.
Trump has never been as popular in Canada as with parts of the US public. One poll earlier this year suggested a majority worried that American democracy would not survive another four years of Trump.
Still, while Trump’s time as president put a strain on the bilateral relationship, Canada came away with some wins, notably a successfully renegotiated North American trade deal.
With November’s US election fast approaching, Canada’s political and business class is already ramping up for more trade upheaval.
It's hard to overstate how closely linked the two countries are, especially economically - about C$3.6 billion ($2.6bn; £2.1bn) in trade crossed the border each day last year.
So a planned formal review of the trade deal, along with Trump campaign musings about a worldwide tariff on imported goods have both been cause for concern.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has launched a “Team Canada” project, sending politicians, envoys and business leaders fanning out across the US to pitch the value of Canada, both privately and publicly.
A similar initiative proved successful during the first Trump presidency.
The country will “be ready to deal with whatever gets tossed at us”, Trudeau has said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqll89j98zko,General election: What do manufacturers want from a new government?,"The hum of the factory run by Nimisha Raja in Sittingbourne, Kent, is continuously in the background as the business owner surveys her staff and machinery.
She said it has been ""really, really difficult"" for all businesses in recent times.
With Brexit, the coronavirus pandemic, and rising inflation in the last five years, it has been particularly challenging for a business owner.
The 2024 general election means companies are looking at what the political landscape means for their future.
Ms Raja is the founder of Nim's Cocktail Garnishes, which makes air dried fruit and vegetable products such as snacks and garnishes.
She admits the company has had to increase prices ""a little bit"" but are still not making all their money back from rising energy prices and costs.
She said: ""If we don’t have money to invest in the business we can’t grow.""
Ms Raja said she has had to reduce exports due to Brexit, but continues to import fruits that are not grown in the UK.
She now uses a third party importer because, as a small business, they ""don’t have the time or the resources to be dealing with all the documentation, customs clearance"".
The entrepreneur believes things are beginning to stabilise and does not want ""another upheaval once again with a new government"", and hopes that whoever forms a new government ""is feeling as tired with all the problems and says 'no, let’s just take it easy'"".
The Europa Worldwide Group’s warehouse in Dartford, Kent, sees 100 truckloads of freight pass through each day
It receives imported goods from Europe, which are put on to trailers for distribution around the UK.
Chief executive Andrew Baxter said they made a success of Brexit by ""doing a huge amount of work"" on how to optimise the flow of goods, believing it created a ""great opportunity"" and meant they ""won huge amounts of business by solving those complexities"".
The last year has been more difficult, as after a small period of economic boom following Covid-19 things slowed down with less movement of goods.
Mr Baxter wants lower business taxes, more flexible employment legislation and more flexible legislation in general.
Nick Broom’s company, PVL UK, makes reflective markings for vehicles - from emergency to highways and commercial - and trades with 27 countries from their factory in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.
Due to the company's specialist nature, materials are imported from Europe, America and the Far East.
Mr Broom said he holds a lot more stock than before and has to ""balance the delays in getting goods out to countries that wasn’t there before Brexit"".
The company is setting up a base in Europe to supply their overseas customers more effectively.
He said he would like to see ""genuine long term strategy for export"" from an incoming government, as well as for training and development for workers.
A Liberal Democrat Spokesperson said: ""The Liberal Democrats have a clear plan to boost our economy and our manufacturing sector.
“We will finally deliver fundamental reform of the broken business rates system, with manufacturing being among the biggest beneficiaries; bring down energy prices by investing in cheap, clean, renewable power; and fix the problematic apprenticeship levy to make sure local businesses are able to access the skills they need.
""We have also set out a plan to fix the UK’s broken relationship with Europe and cut down Conservative trade barriers and red tape holding back British businesses.”
The Conservative, Labour, Green and Reform UK parties have been contacted for comment.
In their manifesto, Labour said it would re-establish the Industrial Strategy Council and also ensure the information small and medium-sized enterprises need about trade is readily available from a single point of contact.
The Green manifesto said it would join the customs union as a first step towards full EU membership and invest £12.4bn in skills and training, equipping workers to play a full role in the green economy.
Reform UK has promised to slash red tape and reduce the main corporation tax rate.
